            <p class="text">Tablets can be thought of as small, handheld computers. They're smaller than a laptop, but larger than a smartphone.Tablets take features from both devices to form a kind of hybrid device, somewhere between a phone and computer, but they don't necessarily function the same way as either.Tablets work in very much the same way that most electronics work, especially computers and smartphones. They have a screen, are powered by a rechargeable battery, often include a built-in camera, and can store all kinds of files.</p>
